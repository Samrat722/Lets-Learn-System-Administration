Package management is a method of installing and maintaining (which includes updating and probably removing as well) software on the system.
Package management tools keep track of updates and upgrades so that the user doesnâ€™t have to hunt down information about bug and security fixes.

-yum : 1) It adds the functionality of automatic updates and package management with dependency management to RPM-based systems.
       2) The main configuration file for YUM is at /etc/yum.conf, and all the repos are at /etc/yum.repos.d & File must have an extension .repo.
       3) Yum is a package manager & YUM reads the dependencies file and build instructions, downloads the dependencies, then builds the package.

We can use the following commands to interact with YUM :
1) yum install package-name - Installs the specified package  along with any required dependencies.
2) yum erase package-name - Removes the specified package  from your system.
3) yum search search-pattern - Searches the list of package names and descriptions for packages that match the search pattern and provides a list of package names, with architectures and a brief description of the package contents. Note that regular expression searches are not permitted.
4) yum info package-name(s) - The results of the info command provides the name, description of the package, as well as a link to the upstream home page for the software, release versions and the installed size of the software.
5) yum upgrade - Upgrades all packages installed in your system to the latest release
6) yum history	:Displays history  in past transactions
 
-rpm : 1) It is the package management system used by Linux Standard Base (LSB) -compliant distributions for low-level handling of packages ,Just like dpkg, it can query, install, verify, upgrade, and remove packages, and is more frequently used by Fedora-based distributions, such as RHEL and CentOS.
       2) RPM is a package container that includes information on what dependencies are needed by the package and build instructions.
       3) Still, it cannot manage dependency resolution like YUM. RPM does provide us useful output, including a list of required packages. 
       4) The RPM database is inside /var/lib, and the file is named __db*.
       
We can us following commands to interact with RPM :
1) rpm -ivh filename.rpm => To install an rpm from the file 
2) rpm --erase package-name or rpm -e => Removes the given package. Usually will not complete if package-name matches more than one package, but will remove more than one match if used with the --allmatches flag.
3) rpm --query --all or rpm -qa => lists the name of all packages currently installed.
4) rpm --query --list package-name or rpm -ql => generates a list of files installed by a given package.
